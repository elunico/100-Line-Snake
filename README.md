# 100-Line-Snake
The Snake Game in a single HTML page for &lt; 100 lines of code

This is a simple implementation of the [Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) using p5.js and HTML5 canvas in less than 100 lines of HTML and JS

This is perhaps diminished slightly by the use of a library like p5 for drawing, but all the same it was a fun thing to make.
